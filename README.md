# Localserver

This is a simple python powered localhost server. If no port specified or specified port is not valid, it tries default 8000 port. There is a simple yes/no question for invalid ports.

# Usage

In terminal, change directory to the directory you want to set as server root and run **"localserver"**

Example:

```sh
cd ~/MyServer
localserver
```

or via port:

```sh
cd ~/MyServer
localserver 2125
```
